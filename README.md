# SydFox

## Current base: 57.0.2

A few patches I'm making to debloat Firefox. I think Firefox is pretty good, but it does come with a lot of junk I don't use.

This repo is a set of patches for the base Firefox source. You can [download the source for the base version here](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/). **MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE RIGHT VERSION, STATED ABOVE.**

This is meant to be mix and match, so install whatever patches you feel like using.

### Do you offer prebuilt versions?

No. If anyone wants to offer them themselves or wants to donate some CI time to the project, I'm open to the idea. I don't personally have the resources though.
